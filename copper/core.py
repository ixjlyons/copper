    A :class:`Pipeline` contains a set of :class:`PipelineBlock`s which operate
    on data to produce a final output.

    To create a pipeline, the following two rules are needed: blocks in a list
    processed in series, and blocks in a tuple are processed in parallel.

    Blocks that are arranged to take multiple inputs should expect to take the
    corresponding number of inputs in the order they are given. It is up to the
    user constructing the pipeline to make sure that the arrangement of blocks
    makes sense.

    Parameters
    ----------
    blocks : container
        The blocks in the pipline, with lists processed in series and tuples
        processed in parallel.

    Attributes
    ----------

    Many `PipelineBlock` implementations don't require attributes to update

    creating such a block.

    func : callable(data)
        Function that gets called when the block's `process` method is called.

        whatever is connected to the block.
    func_args : list, optional
        List (or tuple) of additional arguments to pass to `func` when calling
        it for processing. If None (default), no arguments are used.
    func_kwargs : dict
        Keyword argument name/value pairs to pass to `func` when calling it for
        processing. If None (default), no keyword arguments are used.
    name : str, optional, default=None
        Name of the block. By default, the name of the `processor` function is
        used.

        List of callables (callbacks) to run when after the block's `process`
